# Digital-Story-Telling

This project was realized during the TWEB course at the HEIG-VD. The goal of the project is very simple: create a digital story about the three worst plane crashes in the history of humanity by number of fatalities.

We use a [Bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/) to give the website a good look.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://danpa32.github.io/Digital-Story-Telling/).
